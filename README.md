ðŸš€ How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
cd repo-name


Restore the R environment with renv:

install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()


Run the scripts to reproduce the results:

source("scripts/01_simulation.R")
source("scripts/02_real_data_analysis.R")
source("scripts/03_tables_figures.R")

ðŸ“Š Contents

Simulation studies: Results for different parameter settings are stored in simulation_results.rds.

Real data application: Analysis of the real dataset is stored in real_data.rds.

Tables and figures: All tables and figures from the paper can be reproduced by running scripts/03_tables_figures.R.

ðŸ”Ž Reproducibility Notes

Code has been tested on R (>=4.3.0).

Package dependencies are listed in renv.lock.

Randomness in simulations is controlled by fixed seed values (set.seed()).
